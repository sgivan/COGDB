Koonin and colleagues released an updated version of the COG database with significantly broader coverage, http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/D1/D261.full.

So, we need to updated this codebase to use the new data. I think the majority of the work will be in converting the database loading scripts to the new file format. Hopefully the existing database structure will capture the relevant new data.
